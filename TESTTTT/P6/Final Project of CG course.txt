Final Project – 3D Transformation, Modeling, Animation, Texturing, Shading and Lights

Abstract:
   The goal is to implement an application of animated objects, controlled by user.
The code is in C# with OpenGL.

Details:
   1. (Optional) Objects and environment definitions are stored in file (your format). 
            Description includes object’s geometry, lights features and texture information
   2. Objects and view controlled by mouse, keyboard and standard elements of user   
          interface: scrollbars, radio buttons, check boxes etc. 
       Changed dynamically:
          Light properties, shadows and reflections
          Objects’ form and position
          Textures
       View freely varies: 
           Orthogonal-perspective projection and their parameters
           Point of view parameters

Examples of modeling subject to choose:
 - Robot moving in corridor
 - Chessboard with figures (no play algorithm). Figure movement implemented
 - Dolly with “wardrobe”
